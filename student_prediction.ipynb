    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Educational institutions constantly seek to improve student performance and reduce failure or dropout rates. However, many schools struggle to identify students who are at risk of poor academic outcomes early enough for effective intervention. Traditional evaluation methods rely on exam results, which only reveal problems after they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science offers a proactive solution by using student data, such as demographics, study habits, attendance, and previous grades, to predict academic performance before final exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** capable of predicting a student’s academic performance based on historical and behavioral data. By identifying students likely to perform poorly, schools can implement early interventions such as mentoring, tutoring, or parental engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze student data and build a predictive model that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Classifies students into performance categories (e.g., Low, Average, High), or\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicts their final grade (numerical value).\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights from this model will help teachers and administrators make data-driven decisions to improve learning outcomes and student retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Which factors most influence student performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we accurately predict whether a student will pass or fail before final exams?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can educators use data insights to support at-risk students?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "A trained machine learning model that predicts student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of the top factors affecting academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear recommendations for improving student outcomes based on data analysis."
